# Functional Programming in C#

This repository consists of the source material for my talk, Functional Programming in C#, which I have been presenting at various user groups and Conferences in the UK, US and India.

I also have an ongoing side project to complete the 2018 Advent of Code entirely in Functional-style C#.  I may even have it finished by next Christmas!

Please feel free to make use of any of this code, it's available for anyone that wants it.  In return I'd be grateful for any of the following:

* A nice thank-you on Twitter (@madSimonJ).  It's always good to hear from people.
* A star for this repository
* An invitation to speak at your user group or conference.  I'm based in Shropshire, but am happy to travel (within reason!).

If you have any ideas of your own, please feel free to contribute.

For further reading on this subject, I recommend Functional Programming in C# by Enrico Buonanno, published by Manning.  It's one of the best programming books I've read in years.
